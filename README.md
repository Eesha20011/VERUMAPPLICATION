# IOS APP VERUM 

This is the first version of the IOS application for VERUM: https://verum.ca/fr/ 

VERUM serves to sensitize indivdiuals to observe, learn and apply body movements. It has the power to make people aware of the significance of their unconscious behaviour.
This application is made of three parts. The first part consists of trainings that contain a direct link to the VERUM website from which the user can buy subcriptions. The second part consists of eleven different body parts, including fifty movements in total. This also includes a detailed description of each and every movement. The bonus is that it is assisted by an audio. This MP3 audio file enables the user to multitask as they are using the application. They can analyze their surroundings and apply their learnings while using the application. Even if the user does not remember their progress, the application tracks it for them using Core Data. The third part is a blog containing articles that the user can subcribe to.
